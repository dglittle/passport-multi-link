allows signing in using multiple services simultaneously


**important**
The passport-github package is broken!
[https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-github/pull/7](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-github/pull/7)
But i managed to fix it by custom header

The passport-odesk tokens are outdated!
